// Decision module — given a per-TF regime assessment with a recommended
// playbook, propose a concrete trade plan: side, entry, stop, target,
// risk metrics, and rationale.
//
// Each timeframe is its own self-contained environment (per the per-TF
// architecture in 2026-05-08). The decision module runs once per TF
// that has a tradeable playbook and outputs zero or one TradePlan.
// Higher TFs are visible from the operator's view as conviction context;
// they don't gate trades on other TFs.
//
// Pure functions only. The decision module reads analysis state and
// regime output; it doesn't touch the DB, doesn't place orders, doesn't
// have side effects. Order placement is the execution module's job
// (not yet built).
//
// V0 scope: real geometry (entry/stop/target derived from arms + pools),
// per-playbook logic, no per-tenant config yet (defaults in module).
// Later: tenant config for risk %, max concurrent, etc.
